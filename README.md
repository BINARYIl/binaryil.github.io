## Overview
In the digital age, URLs play a crucial role in sharing and accessing information. However, sometimes long URLs can be visually confusing or expose sensitive information. The URL to Il Converter provides a solution by converting URLs into a stylish and secure "Il" format.

### Why "Il" Format?
The "Il" format was developed by Binary Il to enhance the visual appeal of URLs while improving security. In this format, every "1" in the URL is transformed into an "I", and every "0" is changed to an "l". This not only adds a touch of style to your links but also obscures the original characters, enhancing security.

## Features
- Convert regular URLs to "Il" format
- Decode "Il" format back to the original URL
- Generate redirect links for "Il" format URLs
- User-friendly interface
- Stylish and secure URL representation

## Usage
1. **Enter URL**: Simply input your URL into the provided form.
2. **Convert**: Click on the "Convert" button to transform the URL into "Il" format.
3. **Decode**: To decode an "Il" format URL, input the "Il" text into the decoding form and click "Decode".
4. **Generate Redirect Link**: Want to share a redirect link? Enter the "Il" text and click "Generate Redirect Link".

## Examples
- **Original URL**: `https://example.com`
  - **Il Format**: `lIIlIllllIIIlIlllIIIlIlllIIIlllllIIIllIIllIIIlIlllIlIIIIllIlIIIIlIIllIlIlIIIIllllIIllllIlIIlIIlIlIIIlllllIIlIIlllIIllIlIllIlIIIllIIlllIIlIIlIIIIlIIlIIlI`

- **Redirect Link**: [https://binaryil.github.io/lIIlIllllIIIlIlllIIIlIlllIIIlllllIIIllIIllIIIlIlllIlIIIIllIlIIIIlIIllIlIlIIIIllllIIllllIlIIlIIlIlIIIlllllIIlIIlllIIllIlIllIlIIIllIIlllIIlIIlIIIIlIIlIIlI](https://binaryil.github.io/lIIlIllllIIIlIlllIIIlIlllIIIlllllIIIllIIllIIIlIlllIlIIIIllIlIIIIlIIllIlIlIIIIllllIIllllIlIIlIIlIlIIIlllllIIlIIlllIIllIlIllIlIIIllIIlllIIlIIlIIIIlIIlIIlI)
  - **Redirects to**: `https://example.com`

## How It Works
The URL to Il Converter utilizes JavaScript and regular expressions to transform and decode URLs. The "Il" format is created by replacing characters based on a predefined pattern. When generating a redirect link, the converter uses the "Il" text to retrieve the original URL.
